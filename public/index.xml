      <description>In June, SFG team members Tyler Clavelle, Grant McDermott, and Juan Mayorga traveled to Palo Alto, California to participate in the 2017 User Summit for Google’s Earth Engine (GEE), a planetary-scale platform for earth science data and analysis. GEE is transforming geospatial research by enabling scientists to ask and answer questions at scales that have never before been possible. Since it’s inception in 2010, researchers have used GEE for hundreds of groundbreaking studies and applications, such as mapping global forest cover, surface water, and malaria risk, in high-resolution.</description>

      <description>SFG has been working with the Blue Halo Initiative since 2014, and my field visits to Montserrat and Antigua and Barbuda showed me just how diverse the Initiative’s sites and programs really are.

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Originally from Portland, Oregon, Kat received a BA in biochemistry with a minor in environmental science from the University of San Diego. After completing her undergraduate degree, she worked in pharmaceutical development for a short time before moving to the Turks and Caicos Islands to pursue her interest in the marine environment. During this time, she conducted monitoring surveys as part of fishery assessments for conch and lobster, which led her to return to graduate school to learn more about fisheries and coastal management.</description>
