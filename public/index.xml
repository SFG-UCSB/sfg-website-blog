      <description>In June, SFG team members Tyler Clavelle, Grant McDermott, and Juan Mayorga traveled to Palo Alto, California to participate in the 2017 User Summit for Google’s Earth Engine (GEE), a planetary-scale platform for earth science data and analysis. GEE is transforming geospatial research by enabling scientists to ask and answer questions at scales that have never before been possible. Since it’s inception in 2010, researchers have used GEE for hundreds of groundbreaking studies and applications, such as mapping global forest cover, surface water, and malaria risk, in high-resolution.</description>

      <description>SFG has been working with the Blue Halo Initiative since 2014, and my field visits to Montserrat and Antigua and Barbuda showed me just how diverse the Initiative’s sites and programs really are. My guide and companion for my two-week trip was Andy Estep, the Waitt Institute’s Science &amp;amp; Field Manager, who has lived and worked in the Caribbean for several years.
We began in Antigua, where we met with Dr.</description>

      <description>We all know the feeling; You find the perfect data set only to discover it’s held hostage in 30 pages of a PDF formatted by a drunk toddler or in 467.5 Excel worksheets spread across 19 workbooks emailed to you by a guy named Melvin. If you’re lucky, maybe there’s an online data platform where you can query some mythical database and download individual data files… One. At. A. Time. In a perfect world, however, all the data you’re nerdy heart could desire is freely accessible via an Application Programming Interface (API).</description>

      <description>When I first started learning to code in R, Google was (and still is) my go-to when I had a question. It didn’t take long to realize that this generally brought me to one of two destinations - StackOverflow or [Insert Name]’s blog. So, I created a StackOverflow account and decided to start my own data science blog. However, I didn’t quite know where to start and spent most of 2016 scoping different platforms.</description>

      <description>Originally from Portland, Oregon, Kat received a BA in biochemistry with a minor in environmental science from the University of San Diego. After completing her undergraduate degree, she worked in pharmaceutical development for a short time before moving to the Turks and Caicos Islands to pursue her interest in the marine environment. During this time, she conducted monitoring surveys as part of fishery assessments for conch and lobster, which led her to return to graduate school to learn more about fisheries and coastal management.</description>
