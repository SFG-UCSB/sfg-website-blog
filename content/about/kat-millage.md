Originally from Portland, Oregon, Kat received a BA in biochemistry with a minor in environmental science from the University of San Diego. After completing her undergraduate degree, she worked in pharmaceutical development for a short time before moving to the Turks and Caicos Islands to pursue her interest in the marine environment. During this time, she conducted monitoring surveys as part of fishery assessments for conch and lobster, which led her to return to graduate school to learn more about fisheries and coastal management. Kat received a master’s degree in coastal marine resource management from UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. Working with Conservation International Costa Rica, she developed a bio-economic model for her thesis to examine the impacts of seafood certification programs designed for small-scale fisheries. Kat’s research interests include bio-economic modeling, aquaculture, innovative data-poor stock assessment methods, and ways in which data science can facilitate easier accessibility to and sharing of fisheries data. Her role at SFG includes using bio-economic modeling to provide scientific input on new fisheries management policies.
