Tyler received his BA as a double major in Biology and Economics from Bucknell University in 2009. Following graduation, he spent two years working as the assistant manager of the Bimini Biological Field Station, a shark research lab in Bimini, Bahamas. After developing an interest in science and policy intersections, Tyler returned to graduate school and earned his Master's degree in coastal marine resource management from the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB. For his thesis work, he developed a bio-economic modeling approach for examining the production of fish meal substitutes in artisanal fishing communities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Tyler's interests include aquaculture, small scale fisheries, offshore renewable energy, and using marine spatial planning and bio-economic modeling to inform policy and management.
