### Contact page ###      
# Since this template is static, the contact form uses www.formspree.io as a proxy. 
#The form makes a POST request to their servers to send the actual email. 
#Visitors can send up to a 1000 emails each month for free.
  
# What you need to do for the setup?
# - set your email address under 'email' below
# - upload the generated site to your server
# - send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
# - click the confirm link in the email from www.formspree.io

# Enable the contact form by entering your Formspree.io email
    email = "your@email.com"
